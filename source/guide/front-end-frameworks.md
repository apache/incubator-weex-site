## Front-end Frameworks in Weex

Front-end technologies seem flourishing and productive. Using front-end frameworks in production is a good way to write maintainable apps.

However, **Weex is not a front-end framework**. Indeed, front-end frameworks are just the syntax layer or DSL (Domain-specific Language) of Weex, they are decoupled from native render engines. In another word, Weex does not rely on any specific front-end frameworks. With the evolution of the technology, Weex can integrate more widely used front-end frameworks as well.

Currently, Weex mainly supports [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Rax](https://alibaba.github.io/rax/), and those frameworks are already integrated into Weex SDK, you don't need to require them manually.

> **Learn some basics of Vue.js or Rax could be very helpful when you are using Weex.**

It is better to learn some basics of Vue.js or Rax before using Weex.

## Vue.js

Weex integrated the v2 version of Vue.js since WeexSDK [v0.10.0](https://github.com/alibaba/weex/releases/tag/v0.10.0) is released at 2017/02/17. Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive front-end framework for building user interfaces. Please refer to its [official website](https://vuejs.org/) for more information.

Please refer to [Use Vue.js on Weex](./use-vue.html) document to learn more technics about Weex and Vue.

## Rax

Rax is a front-end framework with React-compatible APIs.

Please refer to [Rax's official website](https://alibaba.github.io/rax/) to get more information.
