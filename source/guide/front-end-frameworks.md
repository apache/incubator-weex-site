## Front-end Frameworks in Weex

Front-end technologies seem flourishing and productive. Using front-end frameworks in production is a good way to manage apps wr. industry. collaborate, maintainable.

However, **Weex is not a front-end framework**. Indeed, front-end frameworks are just the syntax layer or DSL (Domain-specific Language) of Weex, they are decoupled from native render engines. In another word, Weex does not relay on any specific front-end frameworks, with the evolution of technology, Weex can integrate more widely used front-end frameworks as well.

Currently, Weex mainly supports [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Rax](https://alibaba.github.io/rax/), and those frameworks are already integrated into Weex SDK, you don't need to require them manually.

> **Learn some basics of Vue.js or Rax could be very helpful when you are using Weex.**

It is better to learn some basics of Vue.js or Rax before using Weex.
