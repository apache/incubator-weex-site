# How to Contribute

Apache Weex is an open source project that is under active development and we're continuously working out to simplify contributing to Weex ecosystem. Developers can participate and contribute to the Apache Weex community by reporting bugs, contributing code, answering questions, joining in discussions and contributing to documentation.

## Bugs
You can use Weex directly through [Getting Started](./guide/index.html) tutorial. If you encounter any unexpected phenomena during your use, feel free to let us know by filing a bug report.

##### Find Known Issues
We are using JIRA for tracking all the issues and updating whenever when have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to confirm if it is already listed or if there is a fix in progress.

##### Report New Issues
Open a  [JIRA Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/WEEX) , click on the top red "Create" button (you may need to [create a JIRA account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa) if you haven't registered). [Bug Report Guidelines](/bug-report-guidelines.html) document provides some of the most useful information about writing a good bug report. The better your bug report is, the faster we can reproduce and fix it!

## Contribute Code

Apache Weex is an open source project and both, core team members and external contributors, send pull requests which go through the same review process. If you have already decided to start writing code in Weex, Congratulations! You’re up and running.

You can contribute code by either fixing an existing bug or developing new features. In either case, we always encourage to create a JIRA ticket and ensure we are in agreement on your proposal.

To help you get started, we've created a document with more details about development process. Please read **[Getting Started with Development Process](/development-process.html)**.

## Ask or Answer Questions

For basic use problems and help, we suggest you ask questions on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/)  and mark them with **weex** tag.

You can also view all [Weex related issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/weex) and answer some of the questions if you can. This will also help you get familiar with basic concepts and common misunderstandings about Weex, which can be useful when contributing documentation or code.

## Join in Discussions

In Weex community, most discussions happen on the mailing list.

Dev mailing list "dev@weex.incubator.apache.org" is the place where Weex developers exchange ideas and discuss new features, new releases and the development process.

Contributors and developers should subscribe to this list and follow it in order to keep up to date on what’s happening in Weex. [(subscribe)](mailto:dev-subscribe@weex.incubator.apache.org?subject=%28send%20this%20email%20to%20subscribe%29) [(unsubscribe)](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@weex.incubator.apache.org?subject=%28send%20this%20email%20to%20unsubscribe%29) [(archives)](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-weex-dev/)

## Contribute Documentation

Documentation with good quality is a great help to developers. If there is a powerful API that is not easy to use, it becomes useless. So, we welcome any contributions to help Weex's documents become precise and easy to read.

To make changes to the document, you can edit the corresponding Markdown file at the [weex-site repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex-site) and create a pull request.

## How to Become a Committer

Committers are core members of the community who can access the project's repository and modify its code, documentation and web sites, as well as accept the contributions of other developers.

There's no exact criteria for becoming a committer,  we are looking for contributors who are actively involved in community contributions and who have continued interest in Weex. If you are interested in becoming a Weex committer, contact any existing committer and we will help you go through the invitation process.
