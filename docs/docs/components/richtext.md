## Summary

Richtext is used to achieve inline `<span>` or `<a>` combined with inline-block `<image> `. It also supports nested `<span>`, `<image>` and `<a>` with style inheritance and override. Thus, richtext can be considered as a more general `<text>` with more powerful usage.

Only `<span>`, `<a>` and `<image>` are valid children of `<richtext>`. `<span>` and `<a>` are considered as `display:inline`, while `<image>` is considered as `display:inline-block`, which are default values and cannot be changed.

Children of `<richtext>` can be classified as two types of node, **internal** and **external**.
* Internal node can have children nodes.
* External node is not allowed to have any children.
* `<span>` and `<a>` are internal nodes, while `<image>` is external node.

Richtext can be seen as a tree, and the max height of the tree is 255. Any style on a node of which the height is greater than 255 has no effect.

Notes
* `<a>` on iOS will have a `color:blue` style, and children of `<a>` can not override this style. This only happens on iOS. There is no default style and override restriction for `<a>` on Android.
* `<image>` in richtext must have `width` and `height` styles.
* The content area of `<image>` will remain blank until the corresponding image is downloaded and there is no way to display a placeholder image.
* Richtext cannot be nested.

## Attributes

Supported attributes of children of a `richtext`.

#### image

* **src**. Image source.
* **pseudo-ref**. A ref assigned by developers and passed to the callback function of **itemclick**.

#### a

* **herf**. The herf.

#### span

`<span>` does not support any attribute. A text must be set as the content of `<span>`, e.g. `<span>Hello World</span>`.
