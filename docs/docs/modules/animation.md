# animation

The `animation` module is used to perform animation on components. 

JS-Animation can perform a series of simple transformations  (position, size, rotation, background color, and opacity) on the component with Javascript.

For example, if you have a `image` component, you can move, rotate, grow, or shrink it by animation.

:::tip
Ref [transition](../styles/common-styles.html#property) or [transform](../styles/common-styles.html#transform) if you prefer CSS animation.
:::

One can invoke `animation.transition(ref, options, callback)` to start animation. Ref the following code snippets.
```javascript
animation.transition(test, {
    styles: {
        backgroundColor: '#FF0000',
        transform: 'translate(250px, 100px)',
    },
    duration: 800, //ms
    timingFunction: 'ease',
    needLayout:false,
    delay: 0 //ms
    }, function () {
        modal.toast({ message: 'animation finished.' })
    })
```

# API

## transition

#### transition(ref, options, callback)

* **@ref**, the element that will be animated. For example, if the value of `ref` for an element is `test`, you can start an animation with `this.$refs.test`.
* **@options**, animation properties such as keys, duration.
  * **`styles`**, `styles` specifies the names and values of styles to which a transition effect should be applied. The supported styles are listed below:
    * width
    * height
    * backgroundColor 
    * opacity
    * transformOrigin
    * transform
      * translate/translateX/translateY
      * rotate/rotateX/rotateY
      * perspective
      * scale/scaleX/scaleY
  * **`duration`**, `duration` *number* specifies the duration of animation execution, the default value is `0`, meaning that the component get the desired property immediately.
  * **`delay`**, `delay` *number* specifies the waiting time before the animation starts. The default value is `0`. 
  * **`needLayout`**, `needLayout` *boolean* Specifies whether the change to layout(width/height/etc..) is persistence and takes affect after the animation. Default value is `false`
  * **`timingFunction`**, `timingFunction` *string* describes how the intermediate values are calculated for the CSS properties being affected by the animation effect. default value is `linear`, the supported values are listed in the following:
    * `linear`: Specify a transition effect with the same speed from start to end.
    * `ease-in`: Specify a transition effect with a slow start and fast end.
    * `ease-out`: Specify a transition effect with a fast start and slow end.
    * `ease-in-out`: Specify a transition effect with a slow start, fast intermediate and slow end.
    * `cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Define your own values in the cubic-bezier function. Possible values are parameter values from 0 to 1. More information about cubic-bezier please visit [cubic-bezier](http://cubic-bezier.com/) and [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)

* **@callback**, callback is a function called after the completion of animation. In iOS platform, you can use function to get information of animation execution.

::: tip Animatable properties of @style
* **`width`**, the `width` applied to the component after the animation finished. Set `needLayout` to true if you want the change to be persistence. The default value is `computed width`.
* **`height`**, the `height` applied to the component after the animation finished. Set `needLayout` to true if you want the change to be persistence. The default value is `computed height`.
* **`backgroundColor`**, the `backgroundColor` applied to the component after the animation finished. The default value is `computed backgroundColor`.
* **`opacity`**, the `opacity` applied to the component after the animation finished. The default value is `computed opacity`.
* **`transformOrigin`**, the `transformOrigin` indicate the pivot of the element being animated. The possible values for `x-axis` are `left`/`center`/`right`/length or percent, and possible values of `y-axis` are `top`/`center`/`bottom`/ length or percent. The default value is `center center`.
* **`transform`**, transform object, which may include `rotate`, `translate`, `scale` and etc. The detail of  transform is illustrated below.
  * `translate/translateX/translateY`: Specify the location which the element will be translated to.The unit is number or percent and the default value is 0.
  * `rotate/rotateX/rotateY`**v0.14+**: Specify the angle of which the element will be rotated. The unit is **degree** and the default value is 0.
  * `perspective`**v0.16+**: The distance between the z=0 plane and the user. Supported for **Android 4.1** and above. The unit is number and the default value is positive infinity.
  * `scale/scaleX/scaleY`: Stretch or shrink the element. The unit is number and the default value is 1.
:::

::: tip
* On iOS platform you can get animation's message about completion, there are two types of parameters with `result`, is `Success`and `Fail`, Android can not support until now.
* Android doesn't support the result parameter.
