# Setup Develop Environment

Using [Weex Online Editor]((http://editor.weex.io/) is a good choice, but if you want to develop locally on your own machine, you will need to set up your develop environment.

## Install

You will need Node.js and the [Weex CLI](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-toolkit).

There are many ways to install Node.js. The easiest way is to download the executable directly from [Node.js official website] (https://nodejs.org/en/).

> For more installation methods, please refer to [Node.js official information] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
$ npm install -g weex-toolkit
$ weex -v
```
After the installation is complete, you can use the `weex help` command to verify that the installation is successful. It will display all the commands supported by `weex`. You can also check your local development environment with the `weex doctor` command.

## Generate a new Weex project

Use the weex-toolkit, you can generate a weex project just type the command on your terminal:

```bash
$ weex create awesome-project
```

After executing the command, a standard project structure has been generated for us in the `awesome-project` directory.

## Develop

Enter the path of the project. If you choose to install the project automatically when you create the project, you only need to run `npm start` directly after entering the project. You can run the project completely. Otherwise, you need to run `npm in the project beforehand. Install` requires dependencies on the installation project
